Sentiment analysis (opinion mining) is the automated process of
identifying and extracting the subjective information that
underlies in a text. This can be an opinion, a judgment, or a feeling
about a particular topic or subject. The most common type of
sentiment analysis is called ‘polarity detection’ and consists in
classifying a statement as ‘positive’, ‘negative’ or ‘neutral’
